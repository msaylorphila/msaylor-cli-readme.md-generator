## Installation

Prerequisities for this project include node and npm. Clone this repository and write npm i into the project directory. After doing an install of inquirer if you open index.js in your integrated terminal and prompt node to open the file by writing node index.js, you will be given questions to feed to inquirer to write your readme. 

## Usage

This app works by taking in questions from inquirer and creating user prompts.

We then take the responses shared and using project literals we place them into our generator code for our readme file.
